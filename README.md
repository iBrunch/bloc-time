## Explanation

TomaTempo was created with Firebase and AngularJS to provide users with a Pomodoro time management application.

## Problem

Working in an environment with distractions, problems coming from every direction and tons of priorities are hard to manage.

## Solution

TomaTempo is a simple tool to list your tasks and implement a period of focus and rest.

## Results

TomaTempo uses the Pomodoro Technique, which splits your work sessions into 25-minute chunks with five-minute breaks in between. To use this technique, just start the timer and work on your chosen task for the entire time. This way, distracting things like email, messages or aimlessly browsing sites is put off for a reasonable amount of time. You can check these things as a reward during your break. Your break is not allowed to have anything work-related in it.

## Conclusion

With TomaTempo, you have a powerful tool to manage your productivity.
